# YouTube Metadata Retriever

This tool is intended to simplify API queries concerning YouTube videos and playlists.

# API

Get your API Key directly from Google. Keep it safe. Usage is pretty much free unless you're pulling high amounts of data. **You are responsible for the generated API costs** which stem out of using this tool.

# Usage

simply download the repo and run locally or head over to the [webapp](https://youtube-metadata.netlify.app) and run it  there.

# Acknowledgements

This tool is built upon [AnswerQuests](https://github.com/answerquest/answerquest.github.io) code. I rewrote it and added many features.
